Job Portal App
--------------
A Job Portal application built with React.js (Vite) for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The app allows job seekers to search for jobs, apply for them, and manage their profiles. Employers can post job listings and view applications.

Features
---------
Job Listings: View a list of available job postings with details like job title, company, location, and description.

Search & Filter: Search job listings by title, company, location, and other criteria.

User Authentication: Job seekers and employers can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Job Applications: Job seekers can apply for jobs, and employers can view and manage job applications.

Admin Panel: Admins can manage users, job listings, and job applications.

Technologies Used
------------------
React.js (with Vite): Fast frontend development with hot module replacement.

React Router: For routing between pages.

Redux: For state management across the app.

Axios: For making API requests to fetch job data, manage users, and handle job applications.

Node.js: Backend server to handle user authentication, job listings, and applications.

Express: Framework to build the Node.js backend.

MongoDB: Database for storing user profiles, job listings, applications, and more.

Installation
-------------
This project consists of two parts: the Client (React with Vite) and the Server (Node.js). You will need to set up both parts to run the app locally.

2. Set up the Client (React with Vite)
Navigate to the client directory:


cd client
Install the dependencies:


npm install
Run the Vite development server:


npm run dev
This will start the client on http://localhost:5173 (default port for Vite).

3. Set up the Server (Node.js with Express)
Navigate to the server directory:


cd ../server
Install the dependencies:


npm install
Set up environment variables (if necessary):

Create a .env file in the server directory and add your environment variables like database connection strings, JWT secrets, etc.

Run the Node.js server:


node ./index.js
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified in your .env file).
